			<p>
				CVV2/CVC is a three or four digit security code imprinted on credit cards to help
				merchants verify that the customer has a legitimate card in hand at the time of the order. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The merchant asks the customer for the security code and then sends it to the card issuer as part of the authorization request. 
				The card issuer checks the security code to determine its validity, then sends a result back to the merchant along with the authorization.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please see the images at the right to locate your security code.
